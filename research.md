  This page lists your research papers, publications and working papers.  Use
  Markdown to organise your work into sections and link to PDFs or journal
  pages.  If you have a BibTeX file you can include it using plugins such as
  `jekyll-scholar` (not enabled by default).  For a simple list, use plain
  Markdown as shown below.

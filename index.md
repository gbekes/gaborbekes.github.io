  This is the home page for your personal site.  It uses the `single` layout with
  a sidebar author profile, mirroring the look of Fedor Iskhakov’s homepage.
  Feel free to edit the Markdown below to introduce yourself, announce talks
  or events, and link to your CV and other pages.  You can use any Markdown
  syntax supported by Jekyll.  CSS utility classes (e.g. `notice--info`)
  provided by Minimal Mistakes make it easy to highlight important content.

I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Economics and Business](https://economics.ceu.edu/) of Central European University and a senior research fellow at the [KRTK Institute of Economics](https://kti.krtk.hu/) in Hungary.  My research focuses on international economics, economic geography and applied industrial organisation.

Write a longer biography here.  You can start with the following paragraphs taken from my previous website:

I received my Ph.D. degree in 2007 from the Central European University and an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics.  My research is published in journals such as *Management Science*, *Global Strategy Journal*, *Journal of International Economics*, *Regional Science and Urban Economics* and *Economic Policy*.  I have contributed to projects at the European Commission and the European Central Bank.

At CEU I teach a sequence of Data Analysis courses.  With Gábor Kézdi we wrote the textbook **Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy** (Cambridge University Press, 2021).  Visit the [Textbook](/textbook/) page for more information.

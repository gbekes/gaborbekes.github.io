### About me


I received my Ph.D. degree in 2007 from the Central European University and an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics.  My research is published in journals such as *Management Science*, *Global Strategy Journal*, *Journal of International Economics*, *Regional Science and Urban Economics* and *Economic Policy*.  I have contributed to projects at the European Commission and the European Central Bank.

At CEU I teach a sequence of Data Analysis courses.  With Gábor Kézdi we wrote the textbook **Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy** (Cambridge University Press, 2021).  Visit the [Textbook](/textbook/) page for more information.

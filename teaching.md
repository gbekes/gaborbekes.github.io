<!--
  Use this page to describe your teaching activities.  You might list courses
  taught at CEU or elsewhere, share syllabi, lecture slides and assignments,
  and link to any online resources or course websites you maintain.  The
  Minimal Mistakes theme makes it easy to embed downloadable files and
  highlight important information with call‑out blocks.
